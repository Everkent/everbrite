					<h3>Our Story</h3>
					<p>Founded in 2025, Everbrite began as a specialized service provider focused on solving the most challenging industrial cleaning problems. What started as a small team of dedicated professionals has grown into a industry leader known for innovation, reliability, and exceptional results. Our journey began when our founder, Tshepo Mahlake, recognized that traditional cleaning methods were failing to meet the rigorous demands of modern industrial facilities. With a background in engineering and environmental science, he assembled a team of experts to develop safer, more effective cleaning solutions that would set new standards in the industry.</p>
					
					<h3>Our Mission</h3>
					<p>At Everbrite, our mission is to extend the life of industrial assets while protecting both people and the environment. We believe that proper maintenance and cleaning shouldn't come at the expense of safety or sustainability. Through our innovative approaches and cutting-edge technologies, we deliver cleaning solutions that not only restore equipment to optimal condition but also reduce environmental impact and enhance workplace safety. We are committed to helping our clients achieve their operational goals while maintaining the highest standards of environmental responsibility.</p>
					
					<h3>Our Values</h3>
					<p><strong>Excellence:</strong> We never settle for "good enough" - every project receives our full attention to detail and commitment to superior results.</p>
					<p><strong>Safety First:</strong> Our comprehensive safety protocols ensure that every team member and client returns home safely each day.</p>
					<p><strong>Environmental Stewardship:</strong> We develop and utilize eco-friendly cleaning methods that minimize environmental impact.</p>
					<p><strong>Innovation:</strong> We continuously research and implement new technologies to stay at the forefront of industrial cleaning.</p>
					<p><strong>Reliability:</strong> When we commit to a project, our clients can count on us to deliver as promised, on time and within budget.</p>
					
					<h3>Our Team</h3>
					<p>Everbrite's strength lies in our people. Our team comprises certified industrial hygienists, rope access technicians (IRATA/SPRAT certified), corrosion specialists, and environmental experts. Each member undergoes rigorous training and continuous professional development to maintain the highest standards of expertise. Our leadership team brings decades of combined experience in industrial maintenance, environmental services, and engineering, ensuring that we approach every challenge with both knowledge and practical wisdom.</p>
					
					<h3>Certifications & Standards</h3>
					<p>We maintain the highest industry certifications including ISO 9001:2015 for quality management, ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management, and OHSAS 18001 for occupational health and safety. Our technicians hold certifications from NACE International, SSPC, IRATA, and OSHA. We adhere to all relevant industry standards and continuously update our practices to comply with evolving regulations and best practices.</p>
					
					<h3>Our Approach</h3>
					<p>Unlike conventional cleaning companies, Everbrite takes a comprehensive approach to industrial maintenance.
